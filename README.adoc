# I-hate-python
I know C, C++ and bash.  Python hasn't clicked for me yet, so I'm trying again.

Historically, I was trained in OOP long before agile was a thing.  I learned C, but only really
as a stepping stone to get to C++.  Originally, I had intended to become a C++ developer, but
realized that I had a knack for operating systems.  Initially I had learned DOS 6.22, but at 
college was introduced to SCO UNIX and later Linux.  I found I was really interested in learning
this relatively new Operating System, and sunk many hours fighting with 56k modem drivers to 
connect my Linux system into my ISP.  Eventually, the arcane strings of commands required to get
the modem to connect lead to my first clumsy bash scripts.

I worked on Solaris professionally and Linux at night.  Built new hardware and networks in my 
primitive home labs.  My C/C++ became less used and my bash became better.  I initially abused
bash - making it think in object oriented ways.  Pre-declaration of non-scope defined variables, 
pushing libraries into smaller files which were sourced then called based on the state of objects.

I've since simplified to a more functional programming style for my bash scripts - they're still
often overly complicated, but extensible.  I've learned other languages along the way - used php
as a tool at the command line, used perl and javascript before node took it over.  But python has 
historically eluded me.  I don't think like python, I think more structured.  This set of scripts 
are my excercises to try to suck at python less.
