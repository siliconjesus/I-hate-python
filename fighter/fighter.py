# one of the things I code each time I learn a language is a simple fighter program.
# Create two objects who are our fighters.  Both start with a number of hit points
# then the beat each other until one is dead.
# FIRST we need to get some randome seeding - make it easy and use the current date / time
# not truly random but for what I need to do - its close enough.
